# 🗺️ MyMap – Jetpack Compose Polyline Routing

MyMap is a lightweight Android app built with Jetpack Compose and Google Maps. It displays route polylines based on encoded geometry from [Map.ir](https://map.ir/) API. Fully written in Kotlin with a clean architecture approach and beautiful map rendering using the latest Google Maps Compose library.

## ✨ Features

- Decode and draw route polylines using encoded geometry
- Google Maps integration via `maps-compose`
- State-driven UI with ViewModel + `mutableStateOf`
- Prevents multiple API calls on recomposition
- Supports multi-leg route rendering
- Clean, simple structure and reusable components

    val routeDto: RouteDto?
}

private class MutableRoutUiState : RoutUiState {
    override var routeDto: RouteDto? by mutableStateOf(null)
}
```
```
   uiState.routeDto?.let {
                    val polylinePoints = decodeRouteToLatLng(it)
                    Polyline(
                        points = polylinePoints,
                        color = Color.Blue,
                        width = 16f,
                    )
